[technology-description]
actual-stacks-fifty=Allow all stack inserters to move stacks of 50 items at a time; ie one full stack of ore per rotation. Note: Items which stack to LESS than 50 (suck as Rocket Fuel) will be moved at their stack size ONLY (so 10 at a time for Rocket Fuel). This is a limitation of Factorio and this mod cannot address that.
actual-stacks-hundred=Allow all stack inserters to move stacks of 100 items at a time; ie one full stack of plates per rotation. Note: Items which stack to LESS than 100 (suck as ore) will be moved at their stack size ONLY (so 50 at a time for ore). This is a limitation of Factorio and this mod cannot address that.
actual-stacks-twohundred=Allow all stack inserters to move stacks of 200 items at a time; ie one full stack of green circuits per rotation. Note: Items which stack to LESS than 200 (suck as plates) will be moved at their stack size ONLY (so 100 at a time for plates). This is a limitation of Factorio and this mod cannot address that.
