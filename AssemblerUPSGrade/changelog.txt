Version: 1.100.2
Date: 9/21/2020
  Changes:
    - Sorry to existing Plastic Bar ASIF users, I moved the fluid inputs to the edges to better align with the model, and also to explore options to create more fluid ports later on, if needed.
    - Added Rocket Control Unit and Rocket Fuel ASIFs.
    - Changed default ratios for all ASIFs to match what would be needed for 10k science/min. Existing save games will not be affected by this change.
    - Added black bar around all chemical plant ASIFs as the original model doesn't scale well and it's hard to tell where the edges are.
    - Added a subgroup just for ASIFs and moved all the ASIF buildings into that sub-group, then re-ordered them.
    - Removed the no longer needed or used Chemical Factory model. If anyone could make a tint mask for assemblers that'd be great, and I could reduce the size of this mod by about 20MB. I tried to make one...I don't understand graphics.
  Bugfix:
    - Fixed chemical plant basied ASIF smoke and the 'window' on the chemical plant. Both will now colorized correctly given the recipe they are running.
    - Made recipe and alert icons both scale correctly to building size, and be in the correct spot.
    - Fixed a bug in recipe generation causing plastic bars to take more resources and produce less outputs than they were supposed to (to the tune of ~2x the resources for 1/2 the production. Sorry!)

  Bugfix:
    - Plastic Bar ASIF now has fluid ports that actually work.

Version: 1.100.0
Date: 8/29/2020
  Changes:
    - Update to work with 1.0

Version: 1.18.3
Date: 5/14/2020
  Changes:
    - Fixed typos in mod settings. The evils of copy paste.
    - Added ASIF for plastic bar manufacturing.

Version: 1.18.2
Date: 5/14/2020
  Changes:
    - Added a setting to allow for a capped maximum building size. Since placing massive (1000x1000+) buildings is not very fun and extremely difficult, allow for the maximum size of the building, regardless of compression ratio, to be specified as a mod setting.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.18.1
Date: 5/14/2020
  Changes:
    - Set overload_multiplier and requester_paste_multiplier to 1 for all entity recipes (IE: the thing that makes the ASIF itself). This prevents shift-right clicking a logistic chest from requesting enough materials to build 30 asifs and prevents more than one completed ASIF from being stored in the assembler.
