Version: 1.110.3
Date: 5/25/2022
  Changes:
    - Add in code to support priority recievers. Priority recievers must be empty to recieve, but will always be filled before non-priority. The green virtual signal, along with the item you want recieved, will trigger a priority reciever.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.110.2
Date: 2/24/2022
  Changes:
    - Yellow signal now useful and means "Priority only if full". Only effective for senders.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.110.1
Date: 2/8/2022
  Changes:
    - Add /kbt_blocked command to output which teleporters are starved for input (recievers waiting for items)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.110.0
Date: 1/19/2021
  Changes:
    - Verison bump for 1.1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.100.3
Date: 9/25/2020
  Bugfix:
    - Fixed a bug where empty priority teleporters would attempt to send, causing a crash.
	- Fixed a crash with Creative Mod (and probably many others).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.100.2
Date: 9/25/2020
  Changes:
    - Teleporters will not start jobs if their internal buffers are < 90% capacity. In reality, this means if your power grid is suffering due to a brownout, teleporters will stop running, which should help the brownout recover.
  Bugfix:
    - Fixed a bug where the same teleporter could be assigned to multiple jobs at once.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.100.1
Date: 9/22/2020
  Bugfix:
    - Teleporters that are unpowered can no longer send and recieve shipments. Shipments will wait for the source/dest to both be online, and complete their cycles, before transferring cargo.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.100.0
Date: 9/13/2020
  Changes:
    - Forked from bulkteleporters_0.2.0 by Dorfl
    - Rewrote teleporter search algorithm: All teleporters are now checked at least once a second, or every X seconds according to mod setting.
    - Rewrote teleporter search algorithm: Priority receivers are not allowed. Only senders. Configuring a priority receiver (giving a reciver a green signal) will have no additional effect.
    - Rewrote teleporter search algorithm: Senders will remain full and Receiver teleporters will be empty for the duration of their cycles. Any items inserted into a receiver during a cycle will be overwritten and lost. Any items inserted into a sender...won't actually do anything until the next cycle. If you need constant uptime/throughput, service the entity with two teleporters!
    - Greatly increased power draw from teleporting. From 30MW to 1GW for the small, and from 45MW to 4GW for the large.
    - Teleporting cycles now are 4 seconds regardless of distance. (total energy from 300MJ to 4GJ for small, and 450MJ to 16GJ for large).
    - Replaced Teleporter sounds.
    - Changed Fluid Teleporter to use the base_level property. DeMaterializers now want to empty, and Materializers want to fill.
    - Teleporters no longer benefit from modules or beacons.
