Version: 1.100.1
Date: 8/29/2020
  Changes:
    - Add a high-cargo version of the bots, to be used in places where (for example) picking up 100 repair packs per bot isn't a problem. IE: Deconstruction fleets / personal construction bots. Basically just a changeover from normal bots, since I originally did have massive cargo holds on construction bots, but got rid of it to make them behave better at base repair.

Version: 0.0.3
Date: 1/29/2020
  Changes
    - Added setting to allow for larger stacks of uranium fuel cells; makes bulk movement easier.
    - Changed construction robot size back to 1 and reduced the uranium fuel cell cost of building one from 1500 to 250. Reason being that a large inventory for construction bots is harmful when using bots to repair exterior defenses. Also, construction bots rarely have 100% uptime, so their fuel need should be far lower.

Version: 0.0.2
  Changes:
    - Increased logistics bot capacity from 15 to 100 items. Reason being, each bot now costs ~1000x as much material to produce as a normal logistics bot. True, they don't need power, but that much material investment warrants something better than a bot that can only move ~2x as much as a normal bot.
