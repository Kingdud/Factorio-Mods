Version: 1.110.1
Date: 1/21/2021
  Changes:
    - Miners no longer require beacons around them to achieve full speed. Becaons no longer affect UPSgrade miners. Modules can still be used.
    - As a side effect, module slots also had to be removed. The miner building now has the stats of a miner with both 3 prod and 3 speed modules in it. I thought about making two versions but...eh, nuts with it. It's not *that* broken.

Version: 1.0.1
Date: 1/21/2020
  Changes:
    - Added Mod Setting (startup) for how dense the new miners should be. Default is 25:1, but you can go up to 250:1. The Power/pollution/recipe costs scale with density!
