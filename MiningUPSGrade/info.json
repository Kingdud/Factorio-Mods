"description":"Yet another big miner. The goal was to preserve the mining rate, pollution, and energy usage of 25 beaconed (8-per) miners crammed into a single monolithic building. Arguments can be made that it's slightly faster, searches too large an area for ore, etc, but the reality is, it's good enough. This mod, as with most of my other mods, exists to save UPS via reduced entity count while being as non-cheaty as possible."
