enable-max-bld-size=Enable Maximum Building Size setting

[mod-setting-description]
smelter-ratio=A setting of 400 would mean one Bulk Smelter would be equivilant to 400 normal smelters, accounting for beacon effects. (25 - [405] - 2000)
centrifuge-ratio=A setting of 400 would mean one Bulk Centrifuge would be equivilant to 400 normal centrifuges when running both the Uranium Processing and Kovarex processes, accounting for beacon effects. (25 - [405] - 2000)
max-bld-size=A setting of 31 here would mean a square where each side was 31 units long. All lengths are odd to make pipe connections not a PITA. (3 - [25] - 2000)
enable-max-bld-size=Disabling this means the size of the Smelter/Centrifuge will change based on the ratios set above.
